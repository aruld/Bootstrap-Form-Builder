(Look just before the closing `<body>` tag!)\r\n\r\n* Once done, change it back to  build for production using the `build.js` script in the `assets/js/lib`\r\n  folder and [r.js](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/). Then revert to `assets/js/main-built.js`\r\n\r\n* The full command is `r.js -o assets/js/lib/build.js` which should be run from the base directory.\r\n\r\n### Adding new form elements\r\n\r\n* In the [js/data/ folder](https://github.com/minikomi/Bootstrap-Form-Builder/tree/gh-pages/assets/js/data/) are yaml files, each of which corresponds to a tab in the form builder.\r\n* If you just want to add a new element you need to:\r\n  - describe it in one of these files\r\n  - parse the yaml to json using parse.rb in the same folder\r\n  - create a corresponding template in the [templates/snippet directory](https://github.com/minikomi/Bootstrap-Form-Builder/tree/gh-pages/assets/js/templates/snippet)\r\n  - add the template to [snippet-templates.js](https://github.com/minikomi/Bootstrap-Form-Builder/blob/gh-pages/assets/js/templates/snippet/snippet-templates.js)\r\n* If you want to add a new tab, you'll also need to adjust the [app.js file](https://github.com/minikomi/Bootstrap-Form-Builder/blob/gh-pages/assets/js/app.js) to make sure the tab is loaded.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to switch to main.js rather than main-built.js, or the changes you make before compiling with require.js won't show up!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
